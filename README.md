1. Controller (API Layer):
The controller (API layer) receives incoming HTTP requests from the client (e.g., an Angular frontend or a Chrome extension).
The controller's job is to map the requests to the appropriate methods in the business (service) layer.
The controller doesn’t handle the business logic directly; it delegates tasks to the service layer.

2. Service (Business Layer):
The service layer (business logic) contains the core logic of your application. This is where you implement the actual "business rules" or the main logic of your app.
The service layer processes any required business logic and then calls the repository to interact with the database.
The service layer might include tasks like validation, business rules, transformations, etc.


3. Repository Layer:
The repository layer is responsible for communicating with the database. It abstracts the database access, allowing the business layer to remain decoupled from the actual data storage implementation.
In Spring Boot, this layer typically uses Spring Data JPA (or other ORM frameworks) to interact with the database, so you don’t have to write complex SQL queries for most standard CRUD operations.

Full Flow (Request Lifecycle):
Client makes an API call:
For example, an Angular app or Chrome extension sends an HTTP request to your Spring Boot backend, such as POST /api/tasks to create a new task.
Controller receives the request:
The controller maps the API endpoint (/api/tasks) to the corresponding method (createTask), which delegates the task to the service layer.
Business logic in the service layer:
The service layer processes the logic, for example, validating the task data and any business rules. Once validated, it calls the repository to save the task.
Repository interacts with the database:
The repository (e.g., via Spring Data JPA) performs the actual database operations like saving the task to a PostgreSQL database.
Return response to the client:
The saved task is returned to the service layer, which then sends it back to the controller. Finally, the controller returns a response to the client (such as the newly created task HTTP 201 status).
# Ex
API Call: The client sends POST /api/tasks.
Controller: Receives the request, calls TaskService.createTask().
Service: The TaskService adds business logic (like checking for duplicate tasks), and calls TaskRepository.save().
Repository: The TaskRepository saves the task to the PostgreSQL database.
Response: The saved task is returned back to the client

# Conclusion:
API Layer (Controller): Handles HTTP requests and responses.
Business Layer (Service): Contains business logic and processes the request.
Repository Layer: Interacts with the database to retrieve or store dat
